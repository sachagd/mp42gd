Put in the video folder, the video you want (it doesn't need to have a specific name)
Open the python file (mp4py.py) and execute it.
During the execution, you can see the progression of the program in the console.  
Be careful, any file in the image folder is going to be delete.
After the python has been executed, new data has been write in info.json file
Open the spwn file (mp4.spwn) and execute it.
During the execution, you can see the progression of the program in the console.
Open geometry dash.

Be aware that a longer mp4 file or a mp4 file with big resolution will result in the program to take more time to execute.

The python doesn't try to check if two consecutives frame have pixel of the same color at the same place.
In order to optimise the number of object in the editor, each frame have been compress by checking if two or more pixel can appear with a single object.
Even with that, long video with big resolution can cause lag in the game.
